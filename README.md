# Website-Portfolio
This is where I will be working on my full website

Your updated portfolio should contain the following:


Your full name


Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number


A link to a PDF of your resume


A list of 3-5 projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:


Project title


Link to the deployed version


Link to the GitHub repository


Screenshot of the deployed application




Ensure that your portfolio is free of grammar and spelling mistakes
